Good morning:

"I love my metronome".
This sentence came into my head early this morning when I had just finished 
doing my technique.
The device I once viewed as an instrument of torture, not allowing me to sweep 
ahead when I had the impulse and intractable when I wanted to dawdle, has 
become a miraculous friend, with spectral arms which reach out and support me. 
Rather like an accomplished conductor, the metronome gives me a framework on 
which to hang my art.  It, (he? she?) forms a net from which I can spring.
It is a magical machine as well.  

As I slide the weight on the rod, I feel it mastering time.  

In my music room, the metronome controls the flow of each moment.  When it 
clicks, the world goes soft and squishy, and no matter what events happen 
outside, in the room, a second slows or speeds up to the clicking of the 
pendulum.  
An hour can pass by without me having any understanding that time has been 
used.  It is the ultimate living in the moment, and the moment is as long or 
as short as the metronome dictates.  
Finishing a session of playing with the metronome is like waking from a 
dream.  Suddenly you Notice Things.  The sunshine coming in the window has 
shifted position, your shoulders are tired, there is a nice weariness in your 
fingers, you want something to drink.
If I ever have a need to suspend my life, it will be at the piano, with a 
metronome at hand.
