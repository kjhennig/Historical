The Uterus is:
is a major female reproductive organ of most mammals
a really irritating part of my body which has a mind of it’s own
the singular form of the word “uteri”
all of the above

The menstrual cycle:
is 2 - 7 days long
happens at the least appropriate times
is always not what you expect
all of the above

The uterus is connected to 
the vagina
the fallopian tubes
every emotion I ever had
all of the above

Many women’s cycles include:
sensations brought about by the involved hormones 
cramping of the uterus 
emotional sensitivity
feeling bloated
premenstrual water retention
a craving for chocolate
the need for Chinese food
serious considerations of how much time one might get for strangling someone
all of the above

The main function of the uterus is to 
accept a fertilized ovum
develop a healthy endrometrium
give me monthly worries that I might be pregnant
all of the above

In other times and cultures menstruation was a sign:
for women to withdraw from family life (yeah, no more cooking)
girls were considered women 
marijuana was given for pain (lucky Queen Victoria)
chocolate was consumed
all of the above

The human uterus weighs
about a kilogram
2.2 pounds
about a ton during my periods
all of the above

Congratulations!  You have demonstrated your knowledge of wombs … and may now 
proceed to cut and devour that cake, whether you are menstruating or not!
