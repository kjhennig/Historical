Sleep report.

G and I are making progress in our bid to change our waking time from 5:30 a.m. 
to 7:00 a.m.  

We would be doing better without the cat.

Last night, except for a brief waking period at 3:00 a.m. when we both read for 
a little while (me a funny novel, G. a catalogue reporting on the efficacy of 
furnaces) we managed to sleep very well.

At 5:15, the cat started his march around the mattress has been the precursor 
to getting us out of bed for years.  

By 5:30, seeing no movement, the cat began to dig his claws into the mattress 
and tear at the sheets.  First slowly, to be batted at with a foot, and then 
with such tenacity that I was forced to jump out of bed, grab the offending 
animal and hold him to my bare body - a great risk to skin, I might add -, 
thump down the stairs and throw him out.  I then returned to bed to snuggle 
into the warmth.

I forgot the cat door was not only on, but also switched to “out AND IN”.

In minutes the cat was back on the bed, determinedly digging to China through 
the mattress.

G., who wakes growling ferociously, at the first hint of a bark from a 
neighborhood dog, slept blissfully on while I repeated the process of grabbing 
cat, pounding down stairs, and tossing the animal on to the lawn, and then went 
to the basement to hit the “in” switch.

We then slept until 6:58.  We were just stretching and I was about to suggest 
that G hit the button to turn off the alarm clock, when we were deluged in 
details of a flood somewhere and the count of many victims.  

I have not yet gone downstairs, not wanting to face the fury of the cat … who 
has been locked out of the house for 2 hours.   I just hope G has coughed up 
enough treats ……
