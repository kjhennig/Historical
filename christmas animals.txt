I had a thought the other day when I opened another cutsie christmas card 
with mice on it.
What is it about rodents?  Squirrels, mice, rabbits, racoons (are they 
rodents?) seem to come into their own on Christmas.  And robins, cardinals and 
doves.  They are everywhere on Christmas cards.
but, there is a difference.
The birds can be Christmassy while naked (or at least just feathered), while 
the mice, and rabbits need little waistcoats and hats to achieve their 
Christmas status.  Is there something inherently MORE Christmassy about 
birds?  Adding little boots and Santa hats to the rodents gives them a higher 
Christmas score than a naked bird, but just by a bit.  (raccoons seem to need 
fewer clothes, probably because of their masks - but jackets or boots are the 
norm).

Also ... birds get to just perch on mailboxes or branches, mice, rabbits, 
etc.  have to engage in human activities (wrapping gifts, hiding behind 
miniature fireplaces, quaffing drinks).  Squirrels are the cross-over species 
... they are most often seen with hats, but they CAN have Christmas status if 
they are accompanied by nuts.
hmmm ... the relative "Christmasiness of animals"
I worry about these things ... someone has to.  
right ... back to bed.
