I have this idea about "Madrigals in the Mist" (it rains here all the time 
too).  The story of the people who, twenty years ago, got together in this 
lumber town with all the "macho" elements this involves, and sang madrigals 
together.  How it grew and evolved, and is now twenty years old.  I'd like to 
speak about the complexities of bringing formal music to a town which often 
sees itself as rugged as opposed to cultured.  About the love and passion that 
the people in the group bring to their music.  And about the many reasons 
people have for auditioning for and supporting such a group.   And all in THREE 
MINUTES!!!

Voice – In my 40 odd years on this planet, I’ve discovered a few universal 
truths:
It always pays to buy good rain gear
February is the longest month
And
People will find ways to feed their passion, no matter where they live

Twenty years ago in Terrace BC, a small group of people, with nothing in common 
except a love of old music, got together once a week to sing madrigals. Their 
first performance was at the Pacific Northwest Music Festival.  They sang about 
a chicken laying an egg 

(music – segment – the ka, ka neigh stuff 10 seconds )

Since that time they have continued, performing locally, being a showcase choir 
for Music Fest Canada, even attending an international Choral Festival as one 
of 11 choirs representing Canada.  Throughout their 20 years, the Northwest 
Singers have had a commitment to bring their joy of music to the community.  To 
the singers, music is a gift which can savored best when shared.  It’s a 
special feeling.

(Liz Williamson – talking about her conversation with the Cantata Singer guy)

Five years ago I began singing with the choir.  Now I’ve sung with many 
choirs and each has it’s own flavour and traditions.  At first I thought the 
Northwest Singers were rather stuffy.

Our director, Marilyn, is a stickler for detail.  She will stop the choir if an 
R isn’t flipped or if the a comma isn’t observed.  It used to drive me 
crazy.  

But Mailyn’s insistence on detail stems from her deep love and respect for 
the music we perform.  She works hard to ensure that the choir value every 
aspect of a work and perform it as closely as possible to the way the composer 
envisioned it.

(Marilyn speaking of her vision for the choir)

Marilyn’s knowledge of and passion for music has influenced every member of 
the group.  No matter how complex the music, or how many times we fail to get 
things right, rehearsal evenings are filled with a deep joy.  Members savour 
the music and relish the work of making 16 voices become one vibrant entity.  
Those details that used to drive me crazy are now the aspects that delight me.  
They create texture, and excitement, rythmn and style.  After five years with 
the choir I’m still working hard, learning, and valuing a remarkable 
experience.  That goes for others as well.

(Members talking about the group)

It may seem odd that the Northwest Singers exist in this rural town, which has 
relied on forestry for it’s survival.  But people who love to sing, who must 
sing, will find each other.   They will meet and rehearse and perform.   They  
will continue to study and improve because music is essential to their lives 
and they will offer their music to their  community with love.  Far away from 
the province’s cultural centre, the Northwest Singers are continuing to feed 
their passion for music.  

(music – last 6 seconds or so of Sing No more)
Dear Lu:  

Here’s the first draft.  Others I have showed it to say the last paragraph 
sounds really dull.  I don’t like the segway between getting together in the 
beginning and performing or between where we have performed and the rehearsal 
part of the piece – but maybe you can give me some ideas.  Also I realize 
that we are close to a several core First Nations cultural groups so the last 
paragraph will need reworking.  I  think I’m at about 2 and a half minutes.  
What do you think?

Original idea to you:
I have this idea about "Madrigals in the Mist" (it rains here all the time 
too).  The story of the people who, twenty years ago, got together in this 
lumber town with all the "macho" elements this involves, and sang madrigals 
together.  How it grew and evolved, and is now twenty years old.  I'd like to

Twenty years ago in Terrace BC, a small group of people, with nothing in common

share their ardour/passion/enthusiasm? with others so they began to perform.  
Their first performance was at the Pacific Northwest Music Festival where they 
sang about a chicken laying an egg

Sound (music – segment – the ka, ka neigh stuff from "Little White Hen" 10 
seconds )

Since that time they have continued performing locally, being a showcase choir 
for Choir Fest Canada, even attending an international Choral Festival as one 
of 11 choirs representing Canada.  Throughout their 20 years, the Northwest

Draft #2

Dear Lu:

After a day off from this thing I’ve made a few more changes –

I’d like to make this piece more like a madrigal.  One of the key things 
about a madrigal is the way the voices weave in and out of each other.  Is it 
possible for the sounds to weave in and out and for the voice to be over some 
of the music?

I’d like to have music and voices rising and falling, fading in and out and 
coming out of the mist.

Draft #2
(Sound of rain and from the sound of the rain we hear “sigh no more” coming 
out from the sound of the rain then voice over as sound fades):

In my 40 odd years on this planet, I've discovered a few universal truths:
It always pays to buy good rain gear
February is the longest month
And
People will find ways to feed their passion, no matter where they live

Twenty years ago in Terrace BC, a somewhat raw logging and lumber town in 
northwestern, BC, a small group of people, with nothing in common except a love 
of early music, got together to sing madrigals. They longed to share their 
passion so they began to perform.

(sneak in the Little White Hen here while the voice continues) 

Their first performance was at the Pacific Northwest  Music Festival where they 
sang about a chicken laying an egg

 Sound (music - segment - the ka, ka neigh stuff from "Little White Hen" 
seconds )

(fade sound  with voice over) 

And that was only the beginning.
.
 Since then they have not only continued to perform locally, but have been a 
showcase choir for BC Festival of the Arts and have been chosen to attend an 
international Choral Festival as one of 11 choirs representing Canada.  
Although they have received external accolades, throughout their 20 years, the 
Northwest Singers have had a special commitment to bring their joy of music to 
their home community.  To the singers, music is a gift which can savored best 
when shared.  Its a special feeling. 

 (Liz Williamson - talking about her conversation with the Cantata Singer guy 
with music in the background which continues throughout this section – I 
haven’t decided on the music here)

Five years ago I began singing with the choir.  Now I've sung with many choirs 
and each has it's own flavour and traditions.  Our director, Marilyn, is a 
stickler for detail.  She will stop the choir if an R isn't flipped or if the a 
comma isn't observed.  It used to drive me crazy.

 But Marilyn's insistence on detail stems from her deep love and respect for 
the music we perform.  She works hard to ensure that the choir value every 
aspect of a work and perform it as closely as possible to the way the composer 
envisioned it.

(Marilyn speaking of her vision for the choir – with music continuing in the 
background – music ends when Marilyn finishes)

 Marilyn's knowledge of and passion for music has influenced every member of 
the group.  No matter how complex the music, or how many times we fail to get 
things right, rehearsal evenings are filled with a deep joy.  Members savour 
the music and relish the work of making 16 voices become one vibrant entity.  
Those details that used to drive me crazy are now the aspects that delight me.  
They create texture and excitement, rhythm and style.  After five years with 
the choir I'm still working hard, learning, and valuing a remarkable 
experience.   So are the others. 

(Members talking about the group – with voices interweaving over and under 
one another like a madrigal – which move into the last verse of “Sigh no 
more” – next section – voice over)

It may seem odd that the Northwest Singers exist in this raw, rugged and remote 
town which has relied on lumber 
for its survival.  But people who love to sing, who must sing, will find each 
other.  They sing because music is essential to their lives and they offer 
their music to their community with love.  The Northwest Singers continue to 
evoke the harmonies in their hearts as they satisfy their passion for music. 
(okay, I know this is a sucky last sentence – it has the right idea but the 
wrong feeling)

(end with Sigh No More which has been playing through this section)
