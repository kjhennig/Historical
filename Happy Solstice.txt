Happy Solstice:

Today the following conversation happened over morning coffee:

K:  Oh, it's the solstice today.  Should we do anything?
G: Well, we don't have any Oaks on the property, but I could tie you to a 
Maple. 
K: Hmmmm
G:  What are you supposed to do on the solstice?
K:  I don't know, sacrifice a virgin or something?
G:  Well, there goes the cat.
A:  I don't think eunuchs count as virgins, though I may be wrong.
G:  Maybe we should just get a unicorn and slit it's throat in the backyard.
A:  I don't think Safeway brought any unicorns in this year.
G:  No, I'll have to go to the Unicorn specialty store.
A:  Are you kidding?  Those unicorns are FILLED with chemicals.  No, we should 
have thought ahead and ordered a free range unicorn from the deli.  Too late 
for this year, I guess.
K:  Well aren't there some feral unicorns on Thornhill Mountain?  You and your 
friends could go trap one today ....

etc. etc.

see - we don't need hallucinogens,   we're just naturally weird.

By the way - give "Shipping News " a try.  I think you'll like it.  The library 
will have it for sure.

Because I knew you were DYING to know ....

I celebrated Summer solstice by wearing a new black shirt, having lunch with my 
choir director (soon to be leaving town), and finishing the worst of the 19 
things on my "to do" list.  The only virgin was my shirt. It is now worn, and 
no longer a virgin, but it's having a lot more fun.

Off to the gym for an hour before I go to the re-cycling place and help sort 
cans and bottle for a few hours.  It makes me feel dirty and sticky to just 
think about it.

MY I have a fascinating life.
