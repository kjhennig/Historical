Dear Mary Jean and James:

Coffee 

Context is everything.

In the early summer, morning coffee is best on the back balcony.  The scents of 
dark Sumatra combine with those of blossoms and grass.   If you are up in the 
early morning, the silhouette of Copper Mountain looms above you and, as the 
sun crests the summit, sunshine hits you in the face like a bully.

In winter, coffee is best in the sunroom.  Winter demands more complex 
flavours.  The light, reflected off the snow is a swirling Emily Carr painting, 
and mixes with Dark French and Mocha Java.

In the evenings, when one’s coffee consumption is careful and curtailed, my 
coffee cup rests on a small table in the living room.  The scent of subtle Kona 
reflects the warm tones of my harp, and I play and sip, sip and play.

In coffee and in life, context is everything.
