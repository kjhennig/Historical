Hey there man

do you know the whisper of nylon is my way of saying
"I LOVE how you wear me",
the smooth sliding of your arms into my arms molds us as one
and I am 
living to my potential
doing the essential
which is not incidental 
to my world
and when we walk in the cold
and I keep you from the blowing assault of weather
and despite my zipper
you clasp me close against you
I whither with delight
at my exclusive right
to keep you warm at night
and hold you in return.

for in your closet I hang in anticipation
to fulfill my avocation
in celebration 
that
of ALL the  jackets on the rack
you chose me
