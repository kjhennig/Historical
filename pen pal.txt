I'm Canadian, married, working, happy, living in a small town in, BC and 
have a job in the performing arts ... I love to act, I sing, play the piano and 
harp, I try to go to the gym 5 days a week, I walk, and belong to a book club.



A few years ago I realized that, though I have a large group of friends, all my 
male friends were men I had met through their women. Wonderful men, but it got 
me wondering why I didn’t meet men as friends without the filter of women. So 
this is my attempt. 



I'm not sure what you want to write about. I have a tendency to write either 
long, pompous drivel about literature, or (more often) witty or whiny stories 
about my life. I write with a great many comma splices and my use of the 
subjunctive tends to deteriorate when I’m writing quickly. I’m also a very 
poor speller.

I’m interested in how people think and what they do. I’m not interested in 
meeting a Mr. Rochester, Mr. Knightly or Professor Higgins. So if you feel like 
replying, great. And we’ll see how things go.
