Hello my lovely friends:

I was up early today, making pies to bring to Dina’s house for our annual 
Thanksgiving get together … and I had the Goldberg Variations on, and was 
sipping coffee as I was peeling and mixing and rolling etc.   But those things 
make you think … and I started going through all those people in my life who 
have made such a difference.  And I was thinking… “good for us!”

Good for us, that, even if we don’t see each other often, we write when we 
can, we stay in touch as we need to.  Good for us, that we continue to be 
interested in each others’ lives.  Good for us… that we all, if we are need 
to, will be there for each other in whatever way we can be.

I don’t believe in God, or one true love, or love at first sight, or in many 
such things .. but I DO believe that people come into our lives who bring love, 
support, charm, creativity, amazement, interest, stimulation and a whole host 
of wondrous things.  If you are getting this message, you are someone who has 
given me those gifts.

So thank you, my amazing, awesome friend.  It is good to have these special 
days, or we would zoom through our days without taking the time to record these 
thoughts, even though we do think them, I’m sure, often.

I love you all.
