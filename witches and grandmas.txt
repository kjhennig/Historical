Dear Bill:

I was fortunate to grow up near two formidable grandmothers who disagreed on 
most things.

One of their disputes was about keeping witches out of a house.  Grandma 
Hennig, as a girl, had used wheat sprinkled in a circle.  A cross was drawn in 
the wheat every few inches.  Those inside the circle were safe from both 
witches and the devil.

Grandma Zahn laughed as this superstition.  The only thing needed, she 
maintained, was an empty glass bottle hung in a window.  Witches can apparently 
only go through glass one way, so once inside the bottle are trapped forever.

Being a lazy person, I have always used Grandma Zahn' s method, and a glass 
ball in the window has kept my homes witch free.  

I think.

But.

This year I have noticed rotten boards on our deck, failing posts in our fence, 
mildew in the bathroom, and lightbulbs blowing at a prodigious rate.  Could 
these things be signs of witches?  

Perhaps I should start investing in wheat.
