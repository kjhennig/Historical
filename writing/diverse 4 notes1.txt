Note to self re: festival:

 

1. You don't have enough skills. One thing you TRULY lack is the art of making 
voodoo dolls. There are a few Orff teachers who deserve those pins. Learn to do 
this by next festival!!!

2. Don’t have a melt down in front of Catholic School teachers who are 
changing things at the last minute, making it impossible to continue as 
scheduled, and affecting the performances of all the groups who come 
after them. They smile sweetly, inform you that you are overworked and 
overwrought and then calmly continue to do the very thing that is driving you 
mad. Not because they have to, but because they feel like
it.  Melt downs will do nothing except leave an unfortunate stain on the floor. 
 Oh well, they are the chosen ones.

3. Every person who is delivering a prop has a VERY tight schedule and must 
drop it at the theatre at precisely 5:47 a.m. on the day of performance. 
Can’t be 5:46, and can’t be 5:48 - because they are VERY
BUSY and need exact times.  Live with it.

4. Every person who is picking up a prop after a performance (usually the same 
person) isn’t quite sure when they can pick things up. May be this week, 
might be next, but they know you live at the theatre, so, if
they have an extra 10 minutes around midnight one day in June they’ll drop 
by. Probably.

5. Dancers always want the music louder.

6. Dance audiences always want the music softer.

7. Maintenance crews constantly come through, but it is wise to deliver 
“thank you” muffins to their den after a particularly arduous day. Deliver 
many and deliver often.

8. There is never enough room to store equipment - and drum kits get bigger 
each year.

9. No performer ever likes their lighting.

10. In a thing as big as a festival, there are scores of volunteers, teachers, 
organizers, parents, and crew, who try their best. They often get overlooked 
and feel unappreciated so it is a good idea to take a moment to try to give 
them their due.
