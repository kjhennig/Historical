In this essay I will argue that, if Robert did not play the flute … he 
should play …. THE Tuba:

My reasons are as follows:

1.  Robert is obviously a person of extremes.  Why else would he chose to play 
the flute and the piccolo?  From one extreme to the other … Tuba

2.  With hair like that and a pair of Lederhosen he could supplement his income 
playing in an “Ompa-Pa” band.

3.  After a few years around all that brass he’d be great with any plumbing 
… and living in an old house, having a plumber at hand is always convenient.

4.  As principal of a school he’s used to being in charge and no music ends 
until the bass says it can.  If the tuba doesn’t play the tonic, the music 
isn’t over.

5.  With all the noise he makes on his flute every morning, he may as well be 
playing the tuba (you may want to leave this one out … it was contributed by 
Sandy).

Robert’s Ode to A Tuba

Oh tuba mine, my darling one
my hair, your brass, shine like the sun
the others in the group all know
the music ends when we say so

Perhaps you are a little big 
and hard to carry to a gig
but once we are all set in place
your dulcet tones they do embrace

I feel all manly when I hold
within my arms, your gleaming gold
all others envy your deep tones
which echo deep within our bones.

Come, Tuba, fair and be my love,
my arms enfold you like a glove (dove?) - you choose
Others say your tones do quell
but, frankly, they can go to hell.
