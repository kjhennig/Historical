Skeena Stories 150
Be part of history. Tell your story.


August 2008

Skeena Diversity Society is proud to present the Skeena Stories 150 Project. We 
are collecting stories from past and present residents of Terrace and area from 
all backgrounds to create a book in celebration of British Columbia’s 150th 
anniversary.  

Did you or a family member contribute to the building of Terrace? 
(eg. road construction, a bridge, a school, maybe a church or a local business)
Is there a most memorable event or experience you would like to share? 
(eg: community or personal events, favourite places, unforgettable experiences)
Do you have a story of overcoming hardship?
Is there a local hero or role model who inspired you?

Whether your roots are in Terrace or from elsewhere, tell us your story.  
If you know of someone with an interesting story who might prefer to tell it in 
person, contact us to arrange an interview.  We encourage stories in a variety 
of styles, including poetry, or song lyrics.  You may also submit artwork or 
photos that visually tell a local story. Please specify a chapter outlined 
below which fits your submission.
Please submit your entry by October 15, 2008.  Published stories will be 
selected to represent a diversity of personal backgrounds and historical eras.  
The expected publishing date is December 2008.
