the vulnerable waif instruction manual

sent to my friend Michael last year .....

The key to using a cane is to look waif-like.  If you just hobble around, you
look old and ungainly.  You have to look vulnerable.  The secret is to open your
eyes wide, put a look of brave determination on your face, and look as if you
need someone to take care of you.  At that point cars will screech to a stop to
let you cross a street, men will approach you and insist on opening doors for
you, place a hand under your elbow and help you to a seat in a restaurant, women
will solicitously ask if they can fetch you things in stores or in cafes.

You don't have to wait in line, people clear the way for you, despite your 
“"oh,
no, no, I couldn’t possibly take advantage of you all!!  Are you sure?  Well,
thank you SO much, you are all so kind!”"

For some reason, when watching events like parades, if you have a cane, some man
will place a hand on the small of your back and gently guide you to the front of
the crowd.  Sometimes he goes off and finds something for you to sit on as well.
 AND he generally brings you a drink.

At places like the PNE or on buses people get up and offer you seats.

Now that I'm older, I tend to wear shoes that are funky and functional (which
you may have picked up from my pictures), but I still fell down the stairs last
August and had to use a cane for a few days, and it still happened.   In fact my
sister and I went to the PNE  and with me and my cane we got front row seats to
everything we went to see.  She said that she might just try it this year.

And I have a pair of very pretty, flimsy but flat sandals that I wear for such
occasions.  Funky doesn’t work with a cane; delicate and in need of assistance
is the key.

Look vulnerable and waif like

It works!!!!

Take it from a pro!
