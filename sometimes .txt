sometimes

sometimes I want to live a hundred lives so I can meet you a hundred times 
and  know you differently in each venture

I want to savour the exquisite bliss of saying yes - the first time, all 
times.  

I want to say "yes and yes and yes and yes" to all the possibilities in our 
many worlds 

to be smashed with the rapture of our love, shattered by the force of our 
devotion, consumed with the eternity of our connection

to turn the present into a second, a season, an epoch which is ours.
"oh, that was the Age of Love" old historians will say in future years
because, like gluttons, we gorged on our ardor, overflowed with affection, 
burst with lust, were filled to the brim with rapture, tenderness and regard, 
were pitiless in our passion so blazing and zealous that the stars of our world 
moved to the waltz of our desire, thirsty and warm for the tang of our 
emotions. 
I want the mountains to dance and the forests to roar our love; the  
snowflakes to fall with the message "here is love" in their infinite ways. 
I want to reach for you and touch your hand
search for you and catch your gaze
sing to you and hear your voice
come to you and find your arms
and say yes
