As promised:


So what do you think of this concept

There are 3 basic ways of dealing with the world.  

Group one - life is a conquest.

This group sees life as a series of disasters that they must live through.  
These are the people who believe in a malevolent fate, which is out to get them 
personally.  They leave the house on time and see their bus, ahead of schedule, 
streaming by, and say “just my luck”.  If the bus is on time and they catch 
it, they feel that NEXT week, they will miss it every day, because one day of 
good luck must be paid for by many days of bad luck.

They see people at work as colleagues that get in the way of success or are the 
types who will stick a knife in one’s back at the most in opportune time.

These people have a very limited group of people in whom they trust.  And even 
those in the inner circle are tainted with suspicion.   The inner group asks 
for too much money, demands inconvenient holidays, takes up too much time, or 
does other things that divert the protagonist from her/his enjoyment of life.  

Because there is never a break in events in the world, and because each event 
is seen as a disaster or at least as a test, the people in this group never 
relax or can let down their guard.  They live in hope that one day they will 
actually be able to “live”, but don’t realize that in order for that to 
happen - all outside stimuli will have to cease to exist, and all relationships 
will be superficial, because relationships DO demand reciprical responses.  
These are also the people who keep score.  “she hurt my feelings, so I have 
to hurt hers”.  They owe me this, I pay my dues by paying them back and 
making sure they KNOW I have paid them back …. on time … 

these are the list makers of the world.

Group two - life is a job
