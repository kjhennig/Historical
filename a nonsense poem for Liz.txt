A NONSENSE POEM for LIZ
 
The most unusual thing's occurred,
It really is the most absurd!
At a house on M.V. Drive,
The furniture just came alive.
For while the owner was away, 
The furniture was heard to say,
 
"I have never seen the door,
From quite this point of view before.
It's very pleasing - I  declare."
Said the Table to the Chair,
"Well enjoy it while you're able."
Said the Chair unto the Table.
 
"No doubt it will be very soon,
When Liz makes changes to this room.
When she gets back from Tanzania
She'll have some plans, never fear.
We can expect to be uprooted,
Just as we were feeling suited
To this place upon the floor
With lovely vistas of the door."
 
All of them then reminisced on past places
Within the confines of house spaces.
"Do you think that she's aware"
Said the Sofa to the Chair
"Of how we like that bouncy motion
Of our frequent circumlotion
And that as we all get moved around
We make that cheerful bumpy sound."
 
Then they laughed with one another,
Rocked back and forth, and could not recover -
Armchair giggled, laughed and cried.
"Oh!  I've such a stitch in my left side."
"Stop it." gasped the Table, "Stop It!  Do!
I, myself, have lost a screw!"
 
Slowly, slowly they calmed down.
Said that Table was - a clown.
Talked of all the changes seen
And of what great fun it all had been.
In conclusion each agreed
That surely - they - must take the lead.
For such design Liz has great flare,
And with no doubt - is - beyond compare!
