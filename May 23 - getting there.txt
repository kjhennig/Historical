Good Advice

Bare stage, save for a variety of boxes and levels. As the lights dim a 
tape--of women singing is playing in the background. The tunes are varied, 
first nations chanting, hymns, folk songs.  The lights dim to black while the 
music continues.  

When the lights come up they reveal six women sitting and standing at various 
areas of the stage.  They are all dressed alike.  They are frozen.  The tape 
fades away. (Note: before every speech in this section the women clap three 
times ... it becomes a ritual for changing focus).  Each woman unfreezes for 
her speech then freezes again.  They are unaware of each other and talk to the 
audience.

A:	Because of its comparatively soft bristles, the small brush is designed 
to cope with irregularly shaped furnishings.  It allows you to pry into all 
those un-get-able spots that are very vexing.  

(clap, clap, clap)

B:	Go out, the first of fall and find the rosehips.  You take some big 
pails and you fill them up.  You mustn't come home until they're full.

D:  	You should by rights have attacked that stain as soon as the accident 
happened.  But in any case get after it before laundering.

then have it tilted towards the fire in a frying pan until it's golden brown.

and moldings, yield their hidden curls of dust to the searching bristles 
attached to a long extension tube.

because it belongs to the Tsimpshian, the Lakelse Lake.

impossible-to remove them afterward.

(clap, clap, clap)

F:		Give the bootblack 10 cents and the barber, manicurist or 
hairdresser 10% of the bill.  If you're taking a taxi a short distance 10 cents 
is okay, though naturally you'll allow more if he has to carry bags.

B:	You need to do a lot of picking because you have to put them through a 
sieve ... because of the hair inside them.  The only thing you take from them 
is the syrup.

one hand while you brush with the other, and a back-breaking job becomes 
comparatively easy.

C:	That is like cooking in an oven.  Campfire is the most particular thing 
for heating, smoking meat and cooking.

(clap, clap, clap)

D:	First thing in banishing a stain is to find out what caused it. Then 
you have to know your fabric too, and the technique of applying a suitable 
remover - or the cure may be worse than the blemish.

help take the barks off and clean around the place.

A:		The deepest crevices in carved furniture, the most elaborate 
pleats in lamp shades are reached by this gentle-action treatment.

open campfire, not in an oven.

F: 	If you're living in a boardinghouse, a dollar a month for the maid is a 
good idea.  But if you get special service, such as ironing and mending, you 
should up the amount.

she got off the boat.  She came from the old country and when she got off the 
boat the nuns met her and they took her and they put in her what she called the 
tower.  They put her in there for 10 days and they wouldn’t let her see her 
husband to be.  I don’t know why it is, it’s some kind of Catholic rule, I 
guess, and poor dad, he came to get her and he was taken away and he was 
checked for all known diseases.  They were so strict in them days, checked 
everything, everything, before he was allowed to see mom.

After that they got to meet for the first time.

Man 1	I’m Walter

D: 	Hello

Man 1:	I hear you’ve been here for a while

D:	ten days

Man 1:	That’s a while

Man 1: He says I’m really healthy

D: 	oh ….. good

Man 1: yes, real healthy

(pause)

	Did they tell you I have a farm?

D: 	Yes

Man 1:	Nothing too big – but the soil’s good – I’m going to plant 
apple trees when I can.  It’s a great country for apples

D:	oh

Man 1;	Good fruit in Terrace.  You can’t grow good fruit in Kitimat, you 
can’t grow good fruit in Rupert, but Terrace grows good fruit.

D:	Good

Man 1:	And not only apples, berries are good too.

D:	…. Ah

Man 1:	I got horses too.  I’m breeding and selling them

D:	Oh yes …

Man 1:	You like gardening?

Man 1:	And chickens?  We could have lots of chickens if you’re good with 
them.

D:	I guess

Man 1:	Yes, you can do lots with chickens

D:	yes

A:	My parents were born in the states.  My dad was a farmer.  He had a 365 
acre farm in Maine and cattle and sheep, but he was …. He was very ill … he 
had a heart condidtion, and they told mom that he had to come .. to get away 
from that climate, and Grandfather was out here already, … he was here since 
about 1909 I believe, so they packed up and brought us all to Terrace.

We came on the narrow gauge railroad., it was still going then.  I’m not sure 
what point we had to change – but we changed and went on to the Pacific line. 
 I was eight years old, and it took five days and five nights and we arrived in 
Terrace on New Year’s Eve.  It was New Year’s Eve 1936.

A:	But Grandfather was dead by then – he was a prospector, he actually 
made his living digging up gold on Douglas Creek.  But he had 20 acres and dad 
got ten of them and started farming it, or he tried to, but he couldn’t work 
he was too sick.  He had a heart condition, he had three strokes after we 
arrived in Terrace, and he was partially paralyzed on the one side.  He 
wasn’t well at all.

Man 2:	I’m sorry, Maggie, I just couldn’t get up this morning

E:	It’s alright Charles, we’ll think of something

A:	And that’s when my mother started the store.  It was really hard for 
her, because we lived at Pollie …. Where Pollie’s mill is now, and she use 
to walk back and forth, she did all her own books and she handled it.  I don't 
know how she did it.

E:  	(To customer)  That’s  two dollars and eighty cents.  Shall I put 
that on your account?

A:	She ran that store for a couple of years, and then she sold it out.  My 
father wanted to move to Rosswood and he traded his ten acres, for 160 acres in 
Rosswood, because this old fellow, George someone, he was in his 70’s and he 
wanted to get to town and my mom and dad wanted out.  But it was hard for us 
kids 

B:	But I have friends here

E:	(packing)  You’ll make friends soon

B:	I have to go to school

E:	Your father and I have arranged that you can stay at the Daw’s until 
the end of the term, you and Lawrence.  But then you’re coming back to us.  

B:	Is there a school there?

E:	Not yet, but there might be one soon.

A:	It was hard in Rosswood, but it was a lot better than living in 
Terrace.  She always had a good garden and there were berries and at that time, 
there was always meat available, I mean your moose and your deer are walking in 
your back yard, so you never had to look too hard for meat.

E:	(looking out a window)  Lawrence, Lawrence!!! Bring me the rifle, 
there’s a moose right out back.

C:	I was born in 1924, in Port Essington.  I was born on the Indian 
reserve there, and I was about twelve years old when they moved us off the 
reserve because I was non-status.  

My mother was married to a non-Indian.  We were all born on the Indian Reserve 
there.  

They made non-status out of us so that made it sort of hard for me from twelve 
years and having to deal with two worlds. … which I had to learn to do …. I 
managed.  I had to learn fast how to deal with two worlds.  It was hard for me 
at first.  

Oh, there were many tears.  My grandmother cried the day we all walked out the 
door, that day we were forced out.  But I told her, I said, “I’ll be back.  
I don’t care how many years it takes”  I got back but by then she was dead. 
 She was gone in 1948

They moved us out of our place, which had a room for each of us.  My mother had 
ten children and so, counting my mother we were eleven. And they moved us to a 
one bedroom place.  It had running water, but an outside toilet.  It was 
terrible moving from the Indian Reserve, but we had no choice because there 
were few buildings and we had to get off – we took what we could get.

At first I used to sneak back to my grandmother at night to sleep with her on 
the Indian Reserve. 

It was so crowded in our new place that as soon as we were old enough to get on 
our own, we moved.  I moved. 

I moved to Terrace and to other places.  I worked.  I worked in the cannery and 
I worked in cafes. 

I sort of went off keel but I tried my darndest not to forget my language, I 
still understand every world but to speak it fluently like I used to … well, 
I’m still learning.  I joined different organizations when I was old enough.  
I joined  the Friendship ‘Centre and it taught me how to keep, to hang on to 
my culture.  It helped me maintain my dignity, be the person I am.  I remember 
my Grandmother, she always said “Know you are who you are and deal with 
it”.    So this is how I came back as myself.  I had to deal with myself and 
to learn how to respect.

It was a culture shock.  In fact, I think our indian people went through a 
holocaust of their own from this procedure. …. Classing us as non-status.  
They shouldn’t have … should never have done that to anyone you know, 
because this is where all the problems are arising from.  So many years I 
didn’t know who I was, what I was.  I know now.

X:  	I met my husband when he came through to buy horses.  He was a horse 
trader.  I  was just 13 at the time.    He would come through each year and 
stop and have a meal with us.  So the year I was 13 he comes through like 
usual, and he asks me

Man 1 : So you want to go for a horse back ride?

Y:	I don’t know

Man 1:	Sure you do

Y: 	Well, alright

X:	Well he was a handsome young man, why not eh?  And we ride for about an 
hour – and I’m sitting behind him and have my hands on his waist.    And 
I’m having a fine time.  So we stop for a time and we sit on a log.  And we 
talk.  About nothing, really, just weather and stuff.  And the funny part was, 
I didn’t know he was attracted to me until he says:

Man 1:	How’s about we get married.

X:	We’ll I was startled, I didn’t know what to say.

Man 1:	I think you’re grand.  You’d be a good wife.  Let’s get married.

Y:	Well no, I don’t think so.

Man 1:	Come on, we’d have a all right time.  We’d be fine.

Y: 	Well, yeah, we might, but, I’d want to … I’d like to finish 
school first”

Man 1:	Well, come on, now or never

X:	I didn’t know what to say.  I mean I liked him, but I liked school 
too.  But you know my mom and dad liked him so much that they gave their 
consent, and it was about oh 6 or 8 months, later that we finally did get 
married.  I mean we had mom and dad’s consent so it was okay.


	But my wedding was a sad affair, because my father died just threee 
days before we planned our wedding.  He always said “one thing I want to see 
is my daughter’s wedding” but he died just three days before, his heart 
gave out.  

	But before he died he gave me a golden locket – I wore it for my 
wedding and I wore it all the time after that.  It made me close to him.

	We got married in the Catholic church, the old Catholic church in 
Terrce and then we got on our honey moon trip.  We married in Terrace and then 
we went back out to 17 mile which was as far as we could get, because the roads 
were wagon trails, and so we had to snow show through to Iianch.  That was 
where my husband lived.  I’d never walked on snow shoes before.  

Man 1:	Come on, girl, you’ll make it.  

Y:	How long to the cabin

Man 1:	not long, just a few more hours

Y:	I don’t like these things, the snow sticks to them, they’re heavy

Man 1:	That’s because it’s fresh snow.  Here, I’ll get you a stick to 
pack, then you just knock the snow off.

Y: 	I don’t want to carry anything else.

X:	It took us four days.  We packed all our own food, and we stayed in 
those old telegraph cabins.  There were blankets and stuff there which we could 
use, then we’d roll them up and hand them on a wire, across the cabin so the 
mice wouldn’t get into them.  There were dishes there too, but you had to 
wash them and leave it clean for the next person.  You always left shaving too, 
because you never knew who was going to come along hungry and cold and wet.  I 
tell you I was thankful for those shavings – you could get a fire going quick 
with them.  You don’t get cold when you’re walking – but if you fall or 
you have to stop you get cold very quick.

	After 4 days of snow shoeing we got to the Nass and we lived in a house 
near ____ Creek but later we built a cabin.  My man was good at lots of things, 
he’d trade horses, and he had a trap line, and he’d work in the woods 
sometimes too.
	I used to go with him on the trap line.

Man 1:	I’m setting for martin here, this here’s a good place for martin.

Y:	How come not mink?

Man 1:	Not right for mink here.

Y:	How come

Man 1:	It’s just not.

Y:	Well I don’t like to skin’em – so if you get any you do the 
skinning. 

Man 1: Yeah.  Now the next group we set over there, for beaver.

X:	I remember one time we were crossing the river on a log.  My man gets 
all the way across and jumps to the other side and I’m laughing and about to 
jump when ..

Man1:	come on, come on, jump.

Y:	I can’t I’m caught on a limb, it’s got my hair

Man 1:	Well twist it

X: 	I had hooked my locket and I couldn’t get it loose, and I couldn’t 
see

Man 1:	tear it

Y:	I won’t 

Man 1:	I’ll come and get you

Y:	Don’t bounce the log, the thing is stuck tight.

X:	That log jumped and the chain snapped and I ended up falling the water

Y:	My locket!!! I lost my locket!!!

Man 1:	Damn your locket – get out of there

X:	It was only just up to my waist but it was freezing – and by the time 
we got home the pants were just like a board – heavy and cold – but I swear 
I didn’t feel them, I was that upset about loosing my locket.

sounds.  On stage left Man 1 and 2 are sitting, having a drink.  Man 1, the 
husband, is obviously embarressed about the sounds coming from the next room)

D:	The night I was born, let’s see, I’ll have to think back, There was 
a government telegraph operator staying at our house that night.  You know 
where they travelled from cabin to cabin they often spent nights on the road 
and this government telegraph operator was staying there that night and I guess 
he was a married many and he could hear what was happening, you know.  

B:  	(to audience) And that man of mine, was so embarressed, you know?  He 
didn’t like sounds coming out of the bedroom.  He said:

Man 1	Well, I don’t know what’s the matter with my wife, but I think she 
must have indigestion.

D:	And the telegraph operator said:

Man 2:	If you ask me, I’d say she’s going to have that baby.

D:	Now we were a long way from town and I guess my dad got pretty worried 
and didn’t know what to do so:

Man 2:	Don’t worry, I’ll go up the line and find someone for her.  The 
first ones always take a while.

D:	Anyway, this telegraph operator went up the line … walked up the line 
… I don’t know how many miles.  But quite a hike, to get an elderly indian 
lady to come back with him to do what she could for mother.  Though, that took 
quite a time.  The Bulkley River was in flood.  I was born on June 5th, 1908, 
so you can guess from that the river would be flooding out.  Anyway, this 
telegraph operator walked up the line, I can’t remember how many miles and he 
brought back this woman.  But it wasn’t easy.

F:	(As elderly woman)  I don’t go nowhere without my man.

Man 2:	But he’s old, he’ll slow us down

F:	I don’t go nowhere without my man

Man 2:	She’s having a baby

F:	I don’t go nowhere without my man

D:	Of course when they had to cross the river , they had to cross on the 
logs and she was most concerned about her husband.  It took them a long time.

Man 2:	Come on, come on, the baby will have arrived before we get there you 
know, unless we hurry.

D:	But they got there in time and she looked after my mother.  She was a 
wonderful midwife and everything went well from the time she finally got there.















Women sing a song as they pick up imaginary bundles and knapsacks, Pull 
imaginary sleighs, it is obviously cold and the 'going is heavy. one of the 
women (8) is obviously Pregnant during the speech her Labour is obvious.  Two 
men join the group, traveling  slowly.

E:	My Great grandmother Ceceilia had 25 children.  In those days they 
lived on the trail and made camp, they hunt for the food, for them and the dog 
team.  Grandpa would make a kill and their camp was closest to where he made a 
kill.  The first kill would be for them, the next day he would hunt again and 
that would be for the dog team.

Woman groans.  The group stops.  Two women tend to Pregnant woman, men cut 
branches, others make fire

E:	In the summer, they would mainly stay in one spot because it's easier 
to get around on foot, and in the winter they would always travel.  There was a 
store at Telegraph Creek and Grandma and them stayed at Metsantam.  In the 
winter when they were traveling, if the woman was pregnant and went into 
labour, they would lay out brush, make a fly, and she would have her baby.  At 
the time of the birth they made ready a special spot under a big tree.

Two women tend to the pregnant woman.  Perhaps one could sing quietly through 
the next part of the scene.  The others sit around the fire, waiting,

E:	They would all wait for the baby.  My people believe that one who is 
born outdoors will become very wise, and many great things will happen for 
them; they will be blessed with good health and have a long life.

The baby is born by C taking the "baby" out of a box and giving her to the 
mother.  Mother reclines against one of the helpers

E:	Having a baby on the trail is hard.  Sometimes I would tie the cord, 
sometimes my grandmother would, or the one who delivered me.  When babies are 
born in cold weather they're really strong..... or bad tempered.  I delivered 
many babies under a tent frame, on boughs.  Two hours

the bedroom, he was in a long time and then and then he came out and he said to 
Dad he said,

Man 2:	well I can save one or the other, your wife or the baby.  It's up to 
you.  What's your choice?

A:	My dad thinks for a time and they he says:

Man 1: you better save the wife.

A:	But I was sort of stubborn, and so I decided I wasn't going to have any 
of that.  They had to use forceps to pull me out but I came along right away.

Man 1: Is she like alright then?

A:	I was born OK but Mom just couldn't give birth by herself; she
didn't have the strength.  So that was a hard session for Mom.  Thank God we 
had a wonderful lady to take care of me.  Mrs. Nightwine stayed with Mom for a 
week and took care of Mom and me both.











Women move into---next scene.  It may take all of them (passengers nurses, 
etc.) If not, those not in the scene must stay on stage

-E:	My sister Clara had a cleft palate and a hare lip.  She was
about three and a half pounds when she was born.  And mother took her ... she 
took her to Rochester, to the Mayo brothers when she was under a year old and 
she had her done there.f

Man 1: But Edith, why can't we send her to Vancouver?

F:	They know more about such things in the States.  They're more ahead in 
surgery, and there is nothing here, no hospital, nothing.

E:	Of course, mother was an American

F:	Now, I'm leaving Dorothy here, and we'll get a nurse to look
after her, of course you'll also have the cook (to nurse, woman C-), now feed 
her every three hours, and change her regular, and you shouldn't have any 
problems.

(mother boards train with baby and imaginary case.  Sits next to Man 2, 
obviously drunk and obnoxious)

E:	By that time the railway was through so she went on the train
to	Edmonton, and on to Winnipey, then down to Rochester.

F:	(to audience) That was a journey.  Can you imagine me with a
child that young.  I had to feed her with an eye dropper.  We had a week on the 
train, and it was hard for me to wash her, and change diapers.  It was just 
terrible.  It took us a week to get there and the baby was sick all the way. 
(man sneezes directly on the baby and leans onto woman) Can you imagine with a 
sick baby?  I was just 29, but I felt a lot older by the time that trip was 
finished.

(mother steps off the tr

and when I got back, Dorothy was almost dead.  My husband would always say..

Man 1, if mother hadn't gotten back then, Dorothy would have died.  Her feeding 
didn't agree with her.  She was such a little weight when she was born, and her 
feeding didn't agree with her.  Anyway, mother got back and she took one look 
at her and she said

F:	We'll put her on Nestle's, (to audience) that's the milk you make candy 
with, milk that's sweetened?

E:	Condensed milk.

F:	Eagle Brand, because it's very, very, very rich.

E:	And she put me on Eagle Brand Condensed mild and I just
started to thrive and mother always said

F:	If I she hadn't got back when I did, that child would have been dead.

A: What did she know?

B & C: What did she know?

C-clap, clap, clac))

Women move into ext scene, changing any props etc. needed while saying winq

D:	Anyone can do the major part of the week's ironing sitting down.  But 
it does take a little organization before you begin.

A:	Garden tools deserve long-range care.  Keep all tools clean and dry.  A 
pail of sand into which digging implements can be plunged is a big help in 
achieving this.

C:	Remember though, if you're travelling in the U.S.A., tipping rates are 
higher all along the line.

D:	Put the dampened clothes in a basket at your right hand; then place a 
low table or rack to receive the finished pieces, to the left and slightly 
behind you.

A-	Any metal tools which are to be put away for more than a few days at a 
time should first be wiped with an oily cloth to prevent rust.

F:	Shears coated with plant sap should be thoroughly cleaned while it's 
still easy to get the sticky stuff off.

E:	Then treat all the flat pieces, lingerie, children's clothes and even 
the shirts to a quick efficient assembly line job.

(clap. c

8:	We lived in this one room cabin.  Dad cut big blocks of wood for 
stools. one was about this high for Mom to sit on, mom Woman E, sits) and a 
higher one was for me (Woman D sits), and a lower one for Dad.  I'll always 
remember that.  And our table was made of poles, round poles about so big.  And 
he hewed them, and then he nailed them to the wall, and then he had two pegs on 
this
	side to	hold it from falling over. And so this was our beautiful
	table.

	(women I	lie
	down)

	And like	over in the corner there was like a double bed made kind
	of thing	with round poles. And they too were hewed. And then

there were cedar boughs for a mattress, and so this is what we slept on for a 
long time, cedar boughs.  When they'd wear out, you'd go and get some more.  
Beautiful smelling cedar boughs.

But you see, every night, the mice would !go through these branches and 
whatever, and they'd go through our hair, walk by and all over US. I was 
sleeping and I, well, I just took it for granted that the mice lived with you 
and they were really no problem you know.  Why worry about it?

m wakes u

E: Charles, those mice are back again.  Can't you do something?

-Man 2: This is the middle of the forest, mice live here.  What do you want me 
to do.....

(Improvise fight)

B:	Every once and awhile Mom would wake up and blow her stack at Dad, you 
know in the morning.  And I would think, "why is,Mom mad at Dad this morning." 
And I couldn't you know I was.just a little girl, and I couldn't understand all 
of this.  Well of course I got older and could see why Mom would blow her 
stack.  Every once in awhile she'd get tired of these mice going through her 
hair. oh boy.  What a life!

(mom, dad and child get up and prepare for breakfast.  There is obviously an 
uneasy silence going on)

B:	Well anyway, then this went on and out in front of our cabin we have a 
roof out like so far to put the wood under and then there were two troughs 
about three feet long or maybe a little longer , I don't know.

(mom goes out to trough to get supplies, sees it is eaten through, goes to -get 
dad,)

B:	But anyway, each trough has its purpose.  One was for salt meat and the 
other was for salt fish.  And then every once in awhile a porcupine would like 
the salt be coming out of the log, so each would chew a hole or they would chew 
a hole, into these troughs every once in awhile, so Dad would have to make new 
troughs every once in awhile.

Man 2: Porcupines like to chew on the salty wood you see.  I'll make a new one

A:	What did she know?

C:  What did she know?

D and E: What did she know?

All: What did she know?

Women move into new positions singing

D:	I worked for Terrace Drugs in those days, it was located where the 
Terrace Inn is today, and was attached to one end of an old building.  I was 
getting $10.75 a week and when it was a busy 'day there would be it least 
$300.00 in the cash register.  My God, I remember that stuff was cheap, a 
chocolate bar cost 5 cents.

(note, during the entire process, the woman speaking tends the store, stops to 
help customers, charges for things.  Othe-r in the cast are customers although 
it would be good to have-one other to shop girl")

Sometimes I used to fill prescriptions because the pharmacist was always sick.  
The doctor's wife used to work with me and she used to do most of the refilling 
because she knew more than the rest of the staff did.

(to woman) That will be 65 cents please

They worked us hard.  I remember one time it was thirty five below zero and I 
still had to go down to check the fire at the drug store so everything won't 
freeze up, that's on my own time.  The place had no electricity or phone of 
course so we had to light a gas lamp every day.  All this for only $10.75 a week

(to woman) Down the aisle and over there on the shell.  You'll find it about 
half way down.

But we had fun too.  The drug store was open 9 till 9 and one day Mr. Riley was 
sick so we decided to go through boxes ourselves.  We unpacked some boxes and 
ran across some china like dishes.  We washed them all and set them out just 
so, on the table to be sold.  They were so different and well made that many of 
them sold.  We were so proud of ourselves.  While we were selling them Mr. 
Riley came in and he said

Man 2: You fools, that's are pharmacy equipment, put it all away right now.

Mr. Riley was often sick.  When it wasn't too busy we would lock up and bike 
down to Braun's Island and go for a swim in the slough One day when we got back 
and found Mr. Riley there and he was so mad that he fired us on the spot.

Man 2, That's it, you're fired.  The lot of you.  Get out.

The next day we just went to work pretending nothing happened and he didn't say 
anything.
