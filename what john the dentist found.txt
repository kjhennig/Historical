This summer my pre-school friend, Mary Ellen Stewart and I  - both living on 
Mudge for the summer - summoned up enough courage to introduce ourselves to 
“John, the dentist from Denver” who currently owns “Mr. Davidson’s 
House” at Davidson’s Bay on Mudge Island.

As children, Mary Ellen and I would sometimes be taken with our parents to 
visit Jim and Jennie Davidson .. in their posh white house on the island. As 
far as we knew, the Davidson’s had no children (I later found out that they 
have a son).  The Davidson’s were very English old school and children were 
to be seen and not heard.  During care evenings we were expected to sit quietly 
and watch the adults or read, or play with the cats.  We were not to make any 
noise or fuss.

would constantly ask to go upstairs, but never encountered him.

The Stewarts had property on Mudge before the Hennigs, so they went more often 
when we were young.  On hot summer days the Stewarts and the Davidsons would

coifed hair, painted nails and bright red lipstick rang a small bell, Mary 
Ellen, at the age of 6, would be expected to go into the Davidson’s kitchen, 
carefully measure out gin and tonic into glasses, put the glasses on a tray 
(with a doily) and serve drinks to the adults.

Since Mr. Davidson died the house has been through a few owners.  The house was 
built between 1912 and  1220 - the war getting in the way and good quality 
timber not being available to private people for years.  Mary Ellen and I were 
mad to see the improvements and changes made to the house since we were  
children.

“John, the dentist from Denver” invited us to the house with resigned
