Do you ever try to count sheep?
It never works for me.
Firstly I create a gate .. a nice one for the sheep to move through.

Then I start to send the sheep in.  They are nice, fluffy, clean sheep with 
curious expressions and a tendency to look enquiringly at you as they approach.

I can usually get about 9 to 11 through before things go wrong.

Firstly, some of the sheep don't want to go past the gate .. they stop and 
refuse to go through.  Some of them decide they will jump the gate and one 
always gets entangled in some way, causing me to worry.

The next ones start doing silly things.
Some show up wearing tap shoes, others will be carrying a slow cooker or eating 
a book of poetry.  One is always wearing a hat on a rakish angle.  
Some insist on walking backwards through the gate.
One might be baking a cake, or curled up against the fence, typing on a 
computer with a straw held in her mouth.

Some get on two legs and start to waltz.
By that time I am so actively fighting my imagination and trying to get them to 
act like normal sheep that I'm far from relaxed and each time a sheep 
approaches the gate I have this tendency to tighten up to see what that 
particular sheep will do.

It is far from relaxing.
Whoever thought that counting sheep was a way of getting to sleep had no 
imagination .. or rather, could control their imagination.
