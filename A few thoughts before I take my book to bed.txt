A few thoughts before I take my book to bed …. (all of these stolen from 
other people)



Colon, in Greek, means limb

The semi colon, a weapon of literary snobbery

The semi colon: a devise without which, Marcel Proust could not keep sentences 
afloat for pages at a time.

Having only the comma and the full stop is like driving a bike with only 2 
gears.   With a semi-colon you are into mountain bike territory.

A semi-colon was originally introduced because people felt there was a need for 
a longer pause than a comma, but after a while it was realized that it wasn’t 
as simple as that.  So it began to be used as grammatical, as opposed to an 
emotional element.

Semi-colon’s are a sign of a better writer.  It is a sign they have separated 
their thoughts into neater thoughts.

The pace of the writing must go with the pace thought.  And, semi-colons help.


Or, as K once said in a letter:  “If I had a dollar for every semi-colon 
I’ve used, I could retire.”

I close with a poem which I find delightful.  And hope you are still talking to 
me after my lecture earlier on this morning.  




twould be nice to be
an apostrophe
floating above an s
hovering like a paper kite
in between the its
eavesdropping, tiptoeing
high above the thats
an inky comet
spiralling
the highest tossed
of hats


Roger McGough, 1976
