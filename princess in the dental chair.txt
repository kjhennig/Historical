Perhaps the hardest part of being a princess is keeping all the tiaras 
straight.  

Princessing isn't easy, you know.  

Just climbing out of that feather bed, with the extra sable trimming and the 
intricately carved swan motifs each morning can be a chore; and marching down 
the line of respectful maids, ladies in waiting, dressers, attendants and other 
misc. maids before morning coffee is something only a royal constitution can 
stand for any length of time.  Particularly if one just has to go pee.
Then there are the small children who lurk around every corner to thrust a 
poorly constructed bouquet at one, and tongue tied nephews of your mother's 
friends who have been instructed to hurl pretty compliments whenever you enter 
a room.
Just finding some warm food at the table, after the ceremony of the tasting and 
looking under all those silver serving dishes, can be a chore.  
Princessing can be difficult.
Still, the tiaras are hardest.

One just can't decide. 

Is a sapphire tiara just a smidge too outre first thing in the morning?  Would 
it be more circumspect to wear the amber one?   And will the Russian 
emissary's nose be out of joint if, instead of wearing the one made of reindeer 
antlers, I take up the cunning little piece with Alaskan diamonds and rubies?

will it be an International Incident, if I wear the sweet one from Algeria 
twice in one week?  

And the one from Cuba definitely smells of cigars and gives me a headache.

These things came to me as I was sitting in the dentist chair.

It seemed most unfair .....

there I was, getting a crown, and no one appeared with a fur lined cape, a 
scepter, or any of the crown jewels.  

such a travesty.
