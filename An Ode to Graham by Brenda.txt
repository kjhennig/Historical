An Ode to Graham’s Retirement

With Greatest Respect and Apologies to Robert Frost

Stopping by the Garbage Cans on a Snowy Evening

by Brenda Silsbe

Whose junk this is, I think I know,
His house is out in Thornhill though;
He will not care who takes this trash:
The garbage man or thieving crow.

My little wife must think it rash
That I’m so brave and bold and brash,
Foraging for recycling’s sake
And adding to my basement stash.

She gives her little fist a shake,
And asks if I’m compelled to take
All viable technological ware
To see what marvels I can make.

My wife is talented, true, and fair,
And, though she often needs a spare,
She has no love for light bulbs rare.
But, I’ retired.
So, what do I care?
