Neelam and Rhonda:

Congratulations on your marriage, and thank you for allowing me to participate 
in your day.

I send a small gift which will make no sense unless you read the explanation.  

So - for you - a witch ball, my very best wishes, and the following story:

Have a  wonderful life together.

I was fortunate to grow up near two formidable grandmothers who disagreed on 
most things.

One of their disputes was about how to keep witches out of a house.  Grandma 
Amelia, as a girl, had used wheat sprinkled in a circle.  A cross was drawn in 
the wheat every few inches.  Those inside the circle were safe from both 
witches and the devil.  Part of her spring cleaning involved sprinkling wheat 
around the perimeter of her house and adding crosses - although I seem to 
remember that she switched to salt at one point.

Grandma Kate laughed as this superstition.  The only thing needed, she 
maintained, was an empty glass bottle hung in a window.  Witches can apparently 
only go through glass one way, so once inside the bottle are trapped forever.

Being a lazy person, I have always used Grandma Kate' s method, and a glass 
ball in the window has always kept my homes witch free.  

I think.

But.

This year I have noticed rotten boards on our deck, failing posts in our fence, 
mildew in the bathroom, and light bulbs blowing at a prodigious rate.  Could 
these things be signs of witches?  

Perhaps I should start investing in wheat?  ......  but until I know for sure 
.......... I will maintain my faith in Grandma Kate and her bottle, and send 
you something to keep the witches away.

Congratulations and  best wishes.
