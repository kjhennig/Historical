Good morning:

This morning I headed for the gym at 7:00 a.m., before the sun was up and with 
a half moon dangling languidly in a black, then a midnight blue, sky.

We had a heavy frost last night and the streetlights reflected the ice on the 
sidewalks differently with every step.  It was like walking on a ribbon of 
rhinestones.  Magic.

By the time I had finished at the gym, and was walking home it was plain old 
daylight and the walk was pretty much the same as it is every morning, though 
the mountains are very pretty at the moment.

Isn’t it interesting that we can have these enchanting moments in the midst 
of our daily lives?

Running…..
