I don't mean to belabour things .... but I"m having such a nice, laid back 
day ......
So I was looking at the poor children, plowing their way along the sidewalk on 
their way to school this morning (it is still snowing and snowing and snowing 
and the plows can't keep up with the snow .... so they are only doing the bus 
routes) and noting their lunch boxes.
It would have been nice to have a child who ate a wide variety of foods.
Just think of the themed lunches one could make.
A "circle" lunch .... with ritz crackers, slices of cucumber, slices of salami, 
a cupcake sliced in layers
An "orange" lunch ..... carrots, cheese, oranges
An "easter" lunch - hard boiled eggs (coloured), bacon buns, radishes and 
chocolate eggs
A "baby" lunch - cold lamb kebabs, rusks, baby carrots
A "french" lunch - croissant, brie, petite fours and hot chocolate
and if you were angry at your child you could send a "cancer" lunch
nitrate rich foods, diet drinks, red dye 2 candy and a package of cigars.
well, no, I guess not ... but still fun to think about ....

 

I always thought our book club should mirror the book ...
Crepes and Cognac for Collette
Buns and Whiskey for Virginia Woolfe
Vodka and pickled herring for Dostoyevsky
Sausages and tea for Dickens

Hot biscuits and bourbon for Twain

Salmon croquettes and hot toddies for Faulkner
Mint julips and catfish for Tennessee Williams 
Plain water for Kafka

Coffee and croissants for Proust
Pastry pigs and gin for Fitzgerald 

Oh, so much fun to ponder.
I'm having an "in home" day ... as it is much to miserable to leave the house 
... no gym today .... I will do extra juggling practice instead.
OF COURSE you would say stay home re: the concert.  And I promise, if there is 
any danger at all, we will.
